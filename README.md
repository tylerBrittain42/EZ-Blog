# EZ-Blogger
A basic site that will render articles and a table of contents based on a specified directory.

## Example
An example blog can be found at my personal site https://blog.tylerbrittain.xyz/

## Project intentions
The goal of this project is to gain experience with using go templates, specifically with dynamically generating them. Ultimately, I want this to be an executable one-stop shop that will allow a layman to host a blog.


## Env requirements
PORT

TEMPLATE_DIR

ARTICLE_DIR
